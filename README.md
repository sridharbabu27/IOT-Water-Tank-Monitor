# IOT-Water-Tank-Monitor

General we see a lot of water overflowing from the water tanks, this results in a large scale of water wastage in our household.so to avoid this condition We can use Internet of Things to solve this problem.my project is IOT based, this project helps us to know the water level in the tank whether it is in the minimum level or the maximum level we'll get a notification From Twillio messaging API to our mobile number using Bolt IOT module.I have used arduino UNO microcontroller to control the indication LEDs and the buzzer.if the water level is in the minimum condition the red LED glows, if the water level is in Sufficient level the green LED glows, if the water is at maximum level the red LED glows and the buzzer beeps, the Bolt IOT module received the sensor value add request that twilio messaging API to send the messages according to the water level in the tank, if there is a minimum water level then message will be received by the user saying that the tank is empty please switch on the motor, If the water level hey is at maximum level the Bolt IOT module request the twilio messaging API to send the message to the user saying that the tank is full please switch off the motor.
